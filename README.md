# Microframework web

This project is a lightweight Java microframework for building web applications.
It allows developers to:

Register simple GET and POST routes.

Serve static resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

Return dynamic responses using custom services.

The framework is implemented from scratch without external libraries, 
showcasing how an HTTP server and basic routing can be built in pure Java.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Start the server by running:

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="co.edu.escuelaing.httpserver.HttpServer"
   ```

2. The server will listen on port 35000, you can open your browser and try the index file with:
   ```
   http://localhost:35000/index.html
   ```

## ‚úÖ Evaluation (Tests)

### Unit tests
Unit tests were created using JUnit to validate the server‚Äôs functionality:

To run the tests:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

Should look something like this:

### Testing of the developed microframework

- Get Pi with:
   ```
   http://localhost:35000/pi
   ```
  
{Imagen de /pi}

- You can try other resources stored in the resources folder, for example:
   ```
   perrito.jpg
   ```
  or
   ```
   gatito.jpg
   ```

  With:
   ```
   http://localhost:35000/perrito.jpg
   ```

- When you enter your name in the first option, the server will respond with a greeting with a get method. Like this:

- And with the second option the server will return what was written with a post method. Like this:

   <img width="1920" height="909" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94533ed2-74b1-4727-8180-88e595b0aca2" />
